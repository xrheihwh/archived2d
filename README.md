# archived2d
All this is, is a personal archive and backup of my 2D animation related stuff. It's anything I make animation related, goes here. I don't truly intend on others using it, but if you wish to, you absolutely are encouraged to make use of it. Stuff I made is under the GPLv3. Anything else is under whatever license upstream decided on.

Most of it will be GLSL shaders, some of it might be some lower level C or C++ related stuff. Just putting that 2nd one in there in the scenario I might use it.
